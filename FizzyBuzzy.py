"""Dodo's friend Dino challenged him to a new game he had invented - FizzyBuzzy. In this game, players are given a number N and they've to do the following:
- print the numbers from 1 to N, each on a new line,
- but for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. 
Can you help Dodo win the match?"""
