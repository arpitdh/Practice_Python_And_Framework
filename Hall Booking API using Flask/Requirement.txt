There are 6 seminar halls in your college. Hall A has a capacity of 50. Hall B has a capacity of
100. Hall C has a capacity of 200. Hall D has a capacity of 350. Hall E has a capacity of 500.
HAll F has a capacity of 1000. Your task is to create an application to facilitate the followings -



1. Reserve a hall

a. A professor can request a hall while also specifying the required capacity on a
particular day and time. The system should first check all the available halls at
that particular time and respond with the hall that matches the hall capacity to the
request by the professor.

For example, Professor A requests that he needs a hall for 1st Nov at
9.00AM-10.00AM with the capacity of 300. Assuming D and E are already
booked, the system would respond with an option of F.

b. The Professor then sends another request with Hall ID (in this case Hall F) and
the system should then book the hall and update the record in the database.

c. The system should handle race conditions as concurrent users can request the
halls.


2. Fetch details of scheduled seminars for a range of dates (eq- 1 Oct to 5 Oct) from the
database.
